# web-crawler2

A simple web crawler script, written in Clojure. Made for a school assignment.

## Usage

1. Download the project
2. Open command line and navigate to the (project) root directory.
4. run "lein repl"
5. run "(use 'web-crawler2.core)"
6. run "(main arg1 arg2)" (in current version, the main function is not ready yet)

This will generate a file named "hash.txt" in the project root directory. The file will contain:
{ :index-url [vector of the links, found in the index page]
	:url1 [vector of the links, found in the url1's page]
	:url2 [vector of the links, found in the url1's page]
	... etc.}
